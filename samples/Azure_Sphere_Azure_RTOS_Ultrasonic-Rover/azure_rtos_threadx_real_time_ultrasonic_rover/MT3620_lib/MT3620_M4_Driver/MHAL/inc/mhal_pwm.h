  *
  * - \b Normal \b Mode \n
  *   The PWM generates the fixed waveform at the specified frequency
  *   and duty. The application can query current frequency and
  *   duty in current mode. The PWM does not support interrupt mode.
  *   \n
  * - \b 2-state \b Mode \n
  *   There are two configurable states (S0 and S1) for PWM. User can
  *   set individual blink behaviors for these two	states. User can also
  *   specify S0_stay_cycle to configure the stay cycles of S0.
  *
  * - \b 2-state \b Replay \b Mode \n
  *   User can set replay mode with specified S0_stay_cycle and
  *   S1_stay_cycle. PWM would act as [S0->S1->S0->S1->S0... ].
  *
  * - \b Differential \b Mode \n
  *   One PWM channel can be selected as the base channel. Other PWM
  *   channels can be selected as auxiliary channels in the same phase or
  *   reverse phase as the base channel.
